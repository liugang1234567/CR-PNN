Recently，I submitted a manuscript for CR-PNN. 
If you're an editor or reviewer, I am very glad of your asking us for password .  Open for dear you Only, before its publication.
You can contact the corresponding author of the article Jing Wang (my tutor, a professor of Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems, Xi'an Jiao Tong university. e-mail: wangpele@gmail.com ) or me (Gang Liu,a doctoral student of Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems, School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiao Tong University.e-mail: lg_7777777@stu.xjtu.edu.cn).

PS：In order to be more rigorous, we corrected little detail in fig.2 and the graphic abstract. Yet, if you don't want to get these figures, it's OK. The original figures in the paper are also clear, and these errors don't affect my meanings.   (⑅ōᴗō)۶   
I hope you keep safe and sound forever! Take care of yourself ! When you go out, remember to wear a mask.  (⑉• •⑉)‥♡

To show CR-PNN as soon as possible, we "threw" it in arXiv.
Before it's published in the journal, you can cite as: arXiv:2004.03955 [cs.LG]    (or arXiv:2004.03955v1 [cs.LG] for this version)
arXiv:   https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03955

@@@
PS：To be more rigorous, we corrected little details in fig.2 and the graphic abstract.  The original figures in the paper are also clear, and these errors don't affect my meanings.   (⑅ōᴗō)۶  
@@@ Some minor mistakes
   1) "CR-PNN", "RC-PNN" and "C-R PNN" all represent the controllable and readable polynomial neuron network (CR-PNN).
   2) "SMR" in the paper represents "SNR".

I hope you keep safe and sound forever. Take care of yourself . When you go out, remember to wear a mask.  (⑉• •⑉)‥♡

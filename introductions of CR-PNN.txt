----------------Read me: A system analysis methodology: transform method, relation spectrum, and system filter---------
 
Charm of philosophy: Everything happens for a reason——relation spectrum.
(哲学意义： 万事有因果——因果谱。)

I think it may be likely to stand alongside the Fourier. 

Fourier analysis methodology for a single signal. Gang analysis methodology for a system.

1. Transform method (CR-PNN）：Stand alongside the Fourier Transform.  https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03955    [ Submitted to IEEE TNNLS.]

2. Relation spectrum : Stand alongside the frequency spectrum. http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11910    [ Submitted to IEEE tbme.]

3. System filters : Stand alongside filters of frequency.  Title:A novel system analysis methodology: transform method, relation spectrum, and system filter. https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0538/v1 [Look for journals.]

For these original articles of methodology, even though the paper never be published in journals [wait in arXiv all the time], we only submit it to top journals.

If you want to help me famous, to distinguish between other transformations, similar to Fourier，you can call these:  Gang transform, Gang relation spectrum, and Gang system filter. Thank you very much.  (⑉• •⑉)‥♡

@@@CR-PNN
PS：To be more rigorous, we corrected little details in fig.2 and the graphic abstract.  The original figures in the paper are also clear, and these errors don't affect my meanings.   (⑅ōᴗō)۶  
@@@ Some minor mistakes
   1) "CR-PNN", "RC-PNN" and "C-R PNN" all represent the controllable and readable polynomial neuron network (CR-PNN).
   2) "SMR" in the paper represents "SNR".

I hope you keep safe and sound forever. Take care of yourself . When you go out, remember to wear a mask.  (⑉• •⑉)‥♡
